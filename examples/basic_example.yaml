- title: Front page
  content:
  - This is a `webviz` instance created from a configuration file.   
- title: Parameter Distribution
  content:
  - This plugin shows the distribution of the parameters from ERT run. The input can be either CSV file or from Eclipse ensembles in scratch disk. It will also display the best realization for each ensembles.
  - UpCaRsParameterDistribution:
      csvfile: ./aggregated/parameters.csv
      best_realization: [31, 4, 56, 12]
- title: Covariance Analysis Plot
  content:
  - This plugin shows the confidence interval
  - UpCaRsCovan:
      csv_relperm: ./aggregated/relperm.csv
      csv_reference: ./aggregated/reference.csv

- title: Simulation Profile
  content:
  - This plugin visualizes SCAL tables (relative permeability, capillary pressure and fractional flow) and their corresponding Eclipse response. It is possible to choose any parameters as X-axis.
